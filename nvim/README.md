## init.lua

I used Lazyvim for a while but my autocomplete no matter what config felt really slow so I'm using this.
It's based on [ThePrimeagen's config](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua/tree/249f3b14cc517202c80c6babd0f9ec548351ec71).

There was a time I was using coc.nvim and I remember that being fast... maybe I'll look into it. For now though,
this works and I like the speed.

Anyways, it's always going to be a WIP.
